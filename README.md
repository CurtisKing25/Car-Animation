# Car-Animation
This is the first project I made in Processing.
You use the mouse to slide the car right and left.
Car.pde is the first version and Driving_Car.pde is the final version which has rotating wheels.
You can find out more about Processing on https://processing.org/.
You can install a Processing IDE from there, I use and recommend Processing 3.5.4 as 4.0.1 is less stable.
Alternatively here is a tutorial to set it up in Visual studio code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKuu-WcOZYA.
